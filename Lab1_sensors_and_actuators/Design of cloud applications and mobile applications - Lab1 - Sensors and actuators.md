# Configuration
Tried to ping on my Macbook Air M1 using the following command: 
```
ping IOT31.local
```
I discovered my PC had issues finding IPv6 Addresses with the ping command, so when I tried to the following command, it worked: 
```
ping6 IOT31.local
```
Further down, I had no issues establishing a SSH connection.
